# meta-flutter for Yocto Project

This project was created to build the [Embedded Linux (eLinux) embedding for Flutter](https://github.com/sony/flutter-embedded-linux) and [Flutter Engine](https://github.com/flutter/engine) for Yocto Project based distributions.

### Repositories

- [flutter-elinux](https://github.com/sony/flutter-elinux): Flutter tools for eLinux
- [flutter-elinux-plugins](https://github.com/sony/flutter-elinux-plugins): Flutter plugins for eLinux

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

In this README, we explain how to build for Arm64 using `core-image-weston` which is one of Yocto Images, and `kirkstone` which is one of LTS Yocto versions. See also: https://docs.yoctoproject.org/

### Install requred tools

```Shell:
$ sudo apt install chrpath diffstat gawk lz4
```

### Setup Yocto

There are two ways to build using Yocto. One is [builds using bitbake](#build-using-bitbake) and the other is [builds using Yocto SDK](#build-using-yocto-sdk).

Downloading `Poky`, `meta-clang`, and `meta-flutter`:

```Shell
$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git -b kirkstone
$ git clone https://github.com/kraj/meta-clang -b kirkstone
$ git clone https://github.com/sony/meta-flutter.git
```

Setup the build environment using `oe-init-build-env` script in Poky:
```Shell
$ source poky/oe-init-build-env build
```

Set the target machine in `conf/local.conf`:
```
MACHINE ?= "qemuarm64"
```

Add `meta-clang` layer to `conf/bblayers.conf`:
```Shell
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-clang
```

Add `meta-flutter` layer to `conf/bblayers.conf`:
```Shell
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-flutter
```

### Build Yocto SDK (Only when using cross-building with Yocto SDK)

Add the following in your `conf/local.conf`:
```
CLANGSDK = "1"
```
See also: [Adding clang in generated SDK toolchain](https://github.com/kraj/meta-clang/blob/master/README.md#adding-clang-in-generated-sdk-toolchain)

Build Yocto SDK for cross-building:
```Shell
$ bitbake core-image-weston -c populate_sdk
```
See also: [SDK building an sdk installer](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.1/sdk-manual/sdk-manual.html#sdk-building-an-sdk-installer)

Install Yocto SDK:
```Shell
$ ./tmp/deploy/sdk/poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-weston-aarch64-qemuarm64-toolchain-3.1.7.sh
```

## Build using bitbake

### Flutter Engine (libflutter_engine.so)

The default build targets are fixed to Linux, Arm64, and the following Flutter Engine version in the config file.

```
ENGINE_VERSION ?= "d44b5a94c976fbb65815374f61ab5392a220b084"
```

When creating a Flutter project, you will need to use the following version of the Flutter SDK.

| Engine version | Flutter SDK version |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| [d44b5a94c976fbb65815374f61ab5392a220b084](https://github.com/flutter/engine/commit/d44b5a94c976fbb65815374f61ab5392a220b084) | [3.10.0 (stable channel)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/releases/tag/3.10.0) |

If you want to change the version of the Flutter engine, change <engine_version> to the appropriate version of the Flutter SDK and add the following to `conf/local.conf`:
```
ENGINE_VERSION_pn-flutter-engine = "<engine_version>"
```

#### Flutter Engine mode

Flutter Engine is built with release mode by default. If you want to change the build mode, you can change it to add the following in your `conf/local.conf`:

```
# e.g. debug mode
PACKAGECONFIG_pn-flutter-engine = "debug-mode"
```

### Wayland backend

```Shell
$ bitbake flutter-wayland-client
```

### DRM-GBM backend

`libsystemd` is required to build this backend. Put the following in your `conf/local.conf`: 

```
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd"
```
See also: [Using systemd for the Main Image and Using SysVinit for the Rescue Image](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#using-systemd-for-the-main-image-and-using-sysvinit-for-the-rescue-image)

```Shell
$ bitbake flutter-drm-gbm-backend
```

### DRM-EGLStream backend
You need to install libsystemd in the same way with the DRM-GBM backend.

```Shell
$ bitbake flutter-drm-eglstream-backend
```

## Build using Yocto SDK

Setup the cross-building toolchain environment using a script that you built and installed:
```Shell
$ source /opt/poky/3.1.7/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
```

Set the following environment vars to cross-build using clang:
```Shell
$ export CC=${CLANGCC}
$ export CXX=${CLANGCXX}
```

After doing that, you can build the embedder as normal like self-building on hosts. It means you don't need to be aware of cross-building. See: [self-build](https://github.com/sony/flutter-embedded-linux/wiki/Building-Embedded-Linux-embedding-for-Flutter#self-build)
